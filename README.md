### Blockchain based social media

An image-sharing social media site, powered by Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
It allows the users to get rewarded for creating great content and to upload their pictures in a decentralized way. Another important functionality is that the users can tip images uploaded by other users with cryptocurrency. The best images are curated at the top of the news feed based on the amount tipped to the image.
